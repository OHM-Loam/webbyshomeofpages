        <p>So, you're here to get the skinny are you? I will try and keep it simple and not dive into my rather boring past. I feel weird writing this stuff down. However, when I visit someone else's homepage I always go directly to the "personal info" section. I find it fascinating to read some of the nitty gritty on someone who lives hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles from me. So here it goes!</p>

        <p>I was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada on December 26, 1973. I have a 13 year old brother named Chris and a 29 year old sister named Heather. My sister married Terry Hodgson in 1995; they recently had a baby boy named Cody, making me an Uncle!!! I'll be attending <a href="http://www.flemingc.on.ca/">Sir Sanford Fleming College</a> in January 1998 for a post-graduate GIS program, having recently finished my degree at Saint Mary's University. Don't know what a GIS is? <a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/gisfaq?Q2.1">Click here</a> for a brief explanation!</p>

        <p>I am currently a bicycle mechanic and manager at <strong>Slickrock Cycle</strong>. We specialize in high-end mountain bikes like <a href="http://mongoose.com/">Mongoose</a> and <a href="http://www.rocky-mountain.com/">Rocky Mountain</a>. I've been racing for three years, recently placing 5th in the Senior Expert category at the National Championships!</p>

        <p>I'm a bit of a sports nut—snowboarding, rockclimbing, skiing, and motocross. I even tried bungee jumping once (don't attach it to your ankles the first time!). I also love music, from <a href="http://www.grfn.org/~playdead/radiohead/">Radiohead</a> to <strong>Emm Gryner</strong>. My music is vital to my well-being.</p>

        <p>My favourite T.V. shows include Seinfeld, <a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/carp29/spark.htm">South Park</a>, and Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Click Buffy below to visit my fan page!</p>

        <p>I'm also a huge Anne Rice fan. The Vampire Lestat has returned! Check the <a href="http://www.annerice.com/scoop.htm">latest news here</a>.</p>
