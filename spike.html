        <p>James Marsters plays the ultra hip vampire Spike. Spike was introduced to us in the episode "School Hard." In this episode, Giles finds a passage on Spike in one of his dusty books.</p>
        
        <p>It turns out he is a 200-year-old vampire formerly known as <strong>'William the Bloody'</strong> and is responsible for killing two slayers in the last century. The name came from his reputation of torturing people with railroad spikes!</p>
        
        <p>Spike better get his act together if he is going to destroy Buffy. So far he has been getting his tail whipped! Maybe this is because he has been preoccupied with nursing back to full strength his love, Drusilla.</p>
