# Webby's Home of Pages 🌐

Welcome to the revival of **Webby's Home of Pages**! 

This project is a restoration of an old webpage, brought back to life for the modern web. I am currently in the process of cleaning up the legacy code, modernizing the CSS, and ensuring it lives on for a new generation of visitors.

### 🛠 Project Goals
* **Restore:** Bringing back the original layout and content.
* **Modernize:** Updating HTML/CSS to work beautifully on modern browsers (and Macs!).
* **Clean:** Removing old, redundant code while keeping the original spirit alive.

### 🚀 Status
*Current Phase: Initial Restoration & Code Cleanup*

---
*Created with ❤️ on a Mac. This repository serves as the new permanent home for Webby's.*
