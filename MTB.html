        <p>The picture above is me in the 1997 National Championships at Hardwood Hills in Southern Ontario, Canada. I had a good race finishing 5th place out of close to 100 riders in the Senior Expert class. The course was fast with some technical sections and VERY dusty.</p>

        <p>The weekend after the nationals was the <a href="http://www.trilife.com/">24 Hours of Adrenalin</a>. I was in a 4 man elite team named the <strong>Nova Scotia Bluenosers</strong>. The members of my team were Terry Tomlin, Ed Rushton, and Rick Warner. We were always within 5 minutes of the eventual winners, the Disciples of Dirt.</p>

        <p>For the 1997 season I was sponsored by my shop <strong>Slickrock Cycle</strong>, Rocky Mountain Bicycles, Powerbar and Oakley. I rode a Rocky Mountain Vertex Team Only. <a href="rockymountainpage.html">Click here</a> to see the specs and a picture. It was a sweet ride! I also like to road ride—considering 75% of mountainbike training is done on a road bike, I'm glad I do!</p>
